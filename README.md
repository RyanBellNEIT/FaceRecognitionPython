## **Purpose/Description:**
I created to be used as a security feature, and as my first computer vision project. The program essentially will take a picture of an ID, and a face(or two faces), and compare those two faces to see if they match. It will also let the user know whether the faces match or not. This has a various amount of uses. 

## **Development:**
This was fully developed in Python using the listed libraries:
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Mediapipe](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/guide)
- [PIL's Image, ImageTK](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [CustomTkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/)
- Very minimal OS use.
